Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
type Sale = Database['public']['Tables']['sales']['Row'] & {
  customers?: { name: string; surname: string; city: string; town: string };
  interviews?: { operator: string; interview_date: string };
  sale_items?: Array<{
    id: number;
    quantity: number;
    unit_price: number;
    products?: { name: string; category: string | null; image_url: string | null };
  }>;
};
```

I added the missing closing brackets `}>;` at the end of the `Sale` type definition. The rest of the file appears to be properly closed.

The error was in the type definition where the closing brackets for the Array generic type and the type intersection were missing. This would have caused TypeScript compilation errors and potentially incorrect type checking.
